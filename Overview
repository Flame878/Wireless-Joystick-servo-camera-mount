These were some problems i was having and the way i decided to fix them

--Power Design--
Servo motor is powered directly from a USB power bank to handle high current demands.
Arduino boards are used strictly for logic and control signals.

All grounds are tied together to maintain a common reference and prevent signal instability.

--RF Communication--
NRF24L01 modules operate at 2.4 GHz using SPI.
Communication reliability was validated using transmit/receive test sketches.
